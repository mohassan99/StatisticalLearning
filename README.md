# Machine Learning in R  
  
## Syllabus  

### Course Description  
This course introduces modern techniques for statistical analysis of complex and massive data. Examples of these are model selection for regression/classification, nonparametric models including splines and kernel models, regularization, dimension reduction, and clustering analysis. Applications are discussed as well as computation and theoretical foundations.  
### Course Prerequisite  
Knowledge of basic multivariate calculus, statistical inference, and linear algebra. You should be comfortable with the following concepts: probability distribution functions, expectations, conditional distributions, likelihood functions, random samples, estimators, and linear regression models.  
  
### Course Goals and Objectives  
By the end of the course, you will be able to:  
•	Familiarize yourself with a broad range of approaches and techniques in machine learning.  
•	Have a deeper understanding of major algorithms and techniques in machine learning.  
•	Build analytics pipelines for regression problems.  
•	Build analytics pipelines for classification problems.  
•	Build analytics pipelines for recommendation problems.  
  
### Textbook and Readings  
There is no required textbook for this course. Regarding statistical approaches to machine learning, there are two popular textbooks suggested as a resource:  
•	An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R (basic)  
•	The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction (more advanced)
